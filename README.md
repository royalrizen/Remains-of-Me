<summary><h3>Overview</h3></summary>

**Remains of Me** is a 3D psychological sci-fi experience that questions what it means to be human. You begin as a cybernetic experiment — fast, strong, and flawless. But to rediscover your humanity, you must **dismantle** yourself piece by piece. Each piece you remove slows you down… and brings you closer to what you once were.

*This repository contains the **source code** for the game.*
