<summary><h3>Overview</h3></summary>

**Remains of Me** is a 3D psychological sci-fi experience that questions what it means to be human.  
You begin as a cybernetic experiment — fast, strong, and flawless.  
But to rediscover your humanity, you must **dismantle** yourself piece by piece.  
Each piece you remove slows you down… and brings you closer to what you once were.
